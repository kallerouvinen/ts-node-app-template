# TS Node app template

Just a simple template to be used when starting to develop a new app with Node.js and Typescript.

## Getting started

- Change app name and author in package.json

- Install dependencies and run the app in dev mode

  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

## Possible improvements

- Add build command. So far I have developed small Node-apps that I only need to run locally, so this hasn't been deemed necessary.
